## Background - A simple cron app showing Cloud Foundry's standalone apps feature

This app runs in the background and simply prints the timestamp to the log every minute. This app uses the `cron` and `time` modules to schedule jobs and print timestamps.  To run this on Cloud Foundry, you must use the `standalone` framework.

```javascript
//package.json
{
    "name":"background",
    "description":"A simple cron app showing Cloud Foundry's standalone apps feature",
    "version":"0.0.1",
    "private":true,
    "scripts":{
        "start":"node app.js"
    },
    "dependencies":{
        "cron": "*",
        "time": "*"
    }
}
```


```javascript
//app.js
var cronJob = require('cron').CronJob;
new cronJob('* * * * *', function(){
    console.log('Time now: ' + new Date());
}, null, true, 'America/Los_Angeles');
```

## Running Standalone apps
Running an app as `standalone` on Cloud Foundry is very similar to running regular apps, with the following exceptions.

1. The framework should be `standalone`. Sometimes `vmc` auto-recognizes the app as `node` or `ruby` or `java` etc. In that case, select the `other` option and then select `standalone` option.

2. You need to specify how to start the app (`Startup command> node app.js`)

3. Select `none` to `URL` question if your app doesn't run as a web-app like below.
```
1: background.cloudfoundry.com
2: none
URL> 2  <---  Choose 'none' as we don't have a web-UI
```


## Running this example on Cloud Foundry

```
[~/success/git/background]
> vmc push background  <--- Upload app w/ 'background'-app name
Instances> 4   <--- Push app to run on 4 instances

1: node
2: other
Framework> 2   <--- Choose 'other' framework

1: node
2: lift
3: standalone
4: rack
5: sinatra
6: spring
7: play
8: java_web
9: grails
10: rails3
Framework> 3   <---- Choose 'standalone' framework (for background processing)

Startup command> node app.js  <--- Specify how to start the app

1: node
2: node06
3: node08
4: other
Runtime> 3  <--- Use Node.js 0.8v (current latest)

1: 64M
2: 128M
3: 256M
Memory Limit> 64M

Creating background... OK

1: background.cloudfoundry.com
2: none
URL> 2  <---  Choose 'none' as we don't have a web-UI


Create services for application?> n

Bind other services to application?> n

Save configuration?> n

Uploading background... OK
Starting background... OK
Checking background... OK
```

#### Result:
If you look into the logs using the command `vmc logs <appname> --all`, you'll see the timestamp being printed every minute by workers running on each app instance.
